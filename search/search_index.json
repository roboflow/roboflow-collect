This can happen intentionally as a result of changing the scope of your model (i.e. adding a new class to identify, which requires gathering information in a new environment), but can also happen unintentionally (i.e. as a result of adding a camera to collect images in an environment different from that where your model is operating).</p> <p>To measure data drift, first create a new project in Roboflow. Then, provide the ID associated with that project as the <code>DRIFT_PROJECT</code> documented above in the <code>Configure Roboflow Collect</code> documentation.</p> <p>For each frame gathered by Roboflow Collect, there is a 1 in 100 chance that image will be uploaded to your <code>DRIFT_PROJECT</code>.</p> <p>The <code>drift.py</code> script measures the difference between the average CLIP vector in your <code>DRIFT_PROJECT</code> versus the average CLIP vector for all images in the validation set of your <code>ROBOFLOW_PROJECT</code>.</p> <p>After gathering some data from Roboflow Collect, run the <code>drift.py</code> script with these arguments:</p> <pre><code>python3.9 drift.py --ROBOFLOW_KEY=&lt;key&gt; --ROBOFLOW_WORKSPACE=&lt;workspace&gt; --ROBOFLOW_PROJECT=&lt;project&gt; --DRIFT_PROJECT=&lt;drift-project&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Where <code>ROBOFLOW_PROJECT</code> is the main project in which you are gathering data, and <code>DRIFT_PROJECT</code> is where you are randomly collecting images.</p> <p>This script will return a table showing data drift for each month for which data is available, as well as an aggregate score showing how similar images are between your <code>ROBOFLOW_PROJECT</code> and the images collected via Roboflow Collect and saved in the <code>DRIFT_PROJECT</code>.</p>"}]}
